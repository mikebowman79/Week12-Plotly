# Week12-Plotly: Belly Button Biodiversity

For ths challange, the goal is to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Completed construction points of this dashboard are as follows: 

1. Create a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. The horizontal bar chart will display the sample_values as the values, the otu_ids as the labels, and the otu_labels as the hover text for the bars on the chart.
2. create a bubble chart that will display the following when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage:

  a.The otu_ids as the x-axis values.
  b. The sample_values as the y-axis values.
  c.The sample_values as the marker size.
  d.The otu_ids as the marker colors.
  e. The otu_labels as the hover-text values.
  
3. Create a gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.  
4. Customize your dashboard with three of the following:
  a.Add an image to the jumbotron.
  b.Add background color or a variety of compatible colors to the webpage.
  c.Use a custom font with contrast for the colors.
  d.Add more information about the project as a paragraph on the page.
  e.Add information about what each graph visualizes, either under or next to each graph.
  f.Make the webpage mobile-responsive.
  g.Change the layout of the page.
  h.Add a navigation bar that allows you to select the bar or bubble chart on the page.
  i.When the dashboard is first opened in a browser, ID 940’s data should be displayed in the dashboard, and the three charts should be working according to their           requirements.
  j. When a sample is selected, the dashboard should display the data in the panel and all three charts according to their requirements.
